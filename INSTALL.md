# Libraries to install
- `opam install cohttp-lwt-unix`
- `opam install tls-lwt`
- `opam install notty`

If the above doesn't work, then run:

- `opam install lwt`
- `opam install yojson`
- `opam install cohttp`
- `opam install lwt_ssl`

# Run application
- `make build`
- `make run`

NOTE: The app was tested using a VM and worked as expected.
