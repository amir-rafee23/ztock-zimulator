  Stock trading without the risk, but (maybe) all the reward! For the Zimulator 
  makes it possible to see just how well your trading strategies perform before 
  you actually deploy your capital and wreak havoc on markets!

  Specifically, users will be able to buy and add stocks to their portfolio 
  using a finite amount of cash, track its value over time, and view how the 
  value of their portfolio is affected. All these features are deployed through 
  a terminal UI, and do not involve real capital, 

  And so, keep your bank account safe and healthy, with Zazzy, the Ztock Zimulator!
